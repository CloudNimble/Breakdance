Breakdance provides multiple approaches for testing web APIs, each suited to different scenarios.
Choose based on your testing needs:

## Choose Your Approach

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="In-Memory Testing" icon="server" href="/guides/web/aspnet-core-rest">
    **Best for:** Unit testing HTTP APIs you're building without deploying infra

    Fast, no network overhead, great for CI/CD
  </Card>
  <Card title="Request Snapshots" icon="arrow-up" href="/guides/web/snapshots/requests">
    **Best for:** Replicating requests from 3rd party APIs

    `.http` files with variables, request chaining
  </Card>
  <Card title="Response Snapshots" icon="arrow-down" href="/guides/web/snapshots/responses">
    **Best for:** Replicating responses from 3rd party APIs

    Capture once, replay everywhere

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | In-Memory | Request Snapshots | Response Snapshots |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Network calls | None | Optional | Captured |
| Test speed | Fastest | Fast | Fast (cached) |
| Real API testing | No | Yes | Initial capture |
| Offline capable | Yes | With snapshots | Yes |
| Request chaining | Manual | Built-in | N/A |
| Environment configs | N/A | Yes | Per-folder |

## Combining Approaches

These techniques work well together. See the [Snapshots Overview](/guides/web/snapshots/index) for the full philosophy.

```csharp
// Use .http file format with captured response snapshots
public class ApiTests : DotHttpTestBase
{
    protected override HttpMessageHandler CreateHttpMessageHandler()
    {
        // Serve responses from snapshot files
        return new ResponseSnapshotReplayHandler("ResponseSnapshots");
    }

    [TestMethod]
    public async Task GetUsers_Test()
    {
        SetVariable("baseUrl", "https://api.example.com");

        var response = await SendRequestAsync(new DotHttpRequest
        {
            Method = "GET",
            Url = "{{baseUrl}}/users"
        });

        await DotHttpAssertions.AssertValidResponseAsync(response);
    }
}
```
