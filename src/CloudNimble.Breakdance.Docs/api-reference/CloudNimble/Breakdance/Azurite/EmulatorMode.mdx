## Values

| Name | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `SharedPerAssembly` | 0 | One shared Azurite instance per test assembly.
            The instance starts once and is reused by all tests in the assembly.
            This is the default and most efficient mode. |
| `PerClass` | 1 | One Azurite instance per test class.
            A new instance starts for each test class and is shared by all tests in that class. |
| `PerTest` | 2 | One Azurite instance per test method.
            A new instance starts and stops for each individual test.
            This provides maximum isolation but is the slowest option. |
| `Manual` | 3 | Manual lifecycle management.
            The test author is responsible for starting and stopping Azurite instances. |
