**Namespace:** CloudNimble.Breakdance.AspNetCore

**Inheritance:** System.Object

## Syntax

```csharp
CloudNimble.Breakdance.AspNetCore.WebApiConstants
```

## Summary

A set of constants used by BreakDance.WebApi to simplify the configuration of test runs.

## Remarks

Since unit testing a WebApi should not require knowledge of a *specific* endpoint Url to execute (that's required in *integration* testing),
            these constants allow the test to run in a way that abstracts the details of configuring the API away from the developer. That allows the
            developer to focus on what is being tested, not on messing with configuration.
